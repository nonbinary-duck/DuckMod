# DuckMod

DuckMod is a collection of modifications to the game in a server-side environment. The mods will be laid out in a similar style to the menu from [carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet).

If you haven't heard of [carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) I recommend checking it out. It is essential for technical Minecraft players, and also I have to recommend it because of learning fabric by trawling through their repo.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please check out [forking.md](forking.md) for a guide on both how to easily make fabric mods using my repo as a base and also for contributing guidelines and rules.
